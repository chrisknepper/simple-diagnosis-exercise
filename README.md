# Simple Diagnosis Exercise

This is an app created as an exercise to diagnose users with an illness based on their selected symptoms.

## Installation

To run locally via command line:

1. Run `npm install` in the project directory (with a recent version of Node.js installed on the system and available in the system PATH)
2. Install the Python package Flask using either `pip` or `easy_install`
3. Run `npm run dev` in the project directory
4. In another command line window in the project directory, run `python back-end.py`
5. Visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in a browser

## Caveats

1. No service error handling or loading indicator
2. Extremely basic styling
3. The browser's JS intepreter must include the fetch API (Chrome, MS Edge, maybe Firefox)
